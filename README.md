# Workforce Scheduling

Workforce scheduling is a common industry problem that often becomes complex
due to real-world constraints. This example demonstrates
a scheduling scenario with a variety of employees and rules.

## Installation

You can run this example without installation in cloud-based IDEs that support
the [Development Containers specification](https://containers.dev/supporting)
(aka "devcontainers").

For development environments that do not support ``devcontainers``, install
requirements:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
To run the demo:

```bash
python app.py
```

Access the user interface with your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8051/.

The demo program opens an interface where you can configure problems and submit these problems to a solver.

Configuration options can be found in the [app_configs.py](app_configs.py) file.
Please remember to include your dynex.ini file from the Marketplace

### Introducing the Demo

The employee availability chart shows employee shift preferences and unavailable
days (PTO). Requested shifts are in teal and marked with a 'âœ“', while
unavailable shifts are in orange and marked with an 'x'.

In the chart, there are three different types of employees.

- Managers: These are employees with 'Mgr' at the end of their name.
- Employees: These are employees with no tag at the end of their name.
- Trainees: These are employees with 'Tr' at the end of their name. The trainee
  has the same name as their trainer. The trainee can **only** be scheduled to
  work on a shift that their trainer is also scheduled to work.

The chart displays employee preferences and availability over two weeks. It will
always display two weeks starting two Sundays from now, with one column for each day of the two week period.

### Inputs

The scenario preset auto-populates all settings with scenarios of varying
sizes. If 'Custom' is selected, the following settings become available:

- Number of employees: Schedules always include 2 managers and 1 trainee.
- Max consecutive shifts: The maximum number of consecutive shifts an employee
  can be scheduled before a day off must be scheduled.
- Min/max shifts per employee: This range determines the number of shifts an
  employee can work.
- Min/max employees per shift: This range determines how many employees need
  to be assigned to each shift.
- Allow isolated days off: If unchecked, employees must be
  scheduled for at least two consecutive days off between work days.
- Require a manager on every shift: If checked, every shift
  must have exactly one manager on duty to supervise.
- Random seed (optional): If set with an integer, it will ensure consistency
between subsequent runs of the same example.

### Outputs

Once the problem has completed, the best solution returned is displayed in
the "Scheduled Shifts" tab.

The solution returned is either the best feasible solution (if a feasible
solution is found) or the best infeasible solution (if no feasible solution is
found). If an infeasible solution is found, a collapsible error bar will show
on the right side of the demo with more information about what makes the solution
infeasible.
